# 📘 TEMPLATE USAGE GUIDE

## When to Use This Template

Use this template for creating setup/onboarding documentation for:
- ✅ Hardware devices (tablets, POS systems, kiosks, printers)
- ✅ Software applications requiring multi-step setup
- ✅ Integrated hardware + software systems
- ✅ Any new product that requires guided initial configuration

Do NOT use this template for:
- ❌ Feature reference documentation (use TEMPLATE_FEATURE_REFERENCE.md)
- ❌ Troubleshooting guides (use TEMPLATE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- ❌ Day-to-day operational procedures (use operational documentation)
- ❌ API or developer documentation (use TEMPLATE_API_REFERENCE.md)

---

## How to Use This Template

### Step 1: Copy and Rename
1. Copy this template file
2. Rename following convention: `ONBOARDING_[PRODUCT].md`
3. Place in `/onboarding/` directory
4. Examples: `ONBOARDING_TABLET.md`, `ONBOARDING_POS.md`, `ONBOARDING_KIOSK.md`

### Step 2: Replace All Placeholders
Search for `[` and replace each `[placeholder]` with specific information:
- `[Product Name]` → Specific product (e.g., "Kitchen Tablet", "Customer Kiosk")
- `[X-Y]` minutes → Actual time estimate (e.g., "15-20")
- `[portal URL]` → Actual URL (e.g., "portal.blazebite.com")

### Step 3: Delete All Comments
Remove ALL `<!-- comment -->` blocks before publishing. These are guidance for you, not for end users.

### Step 4: Customize Sections
- **Keep all main sections** (📦 What's In Your Box through 📝 Notes)
- **Adjust hardware sections** based on product (some may not need peripherals)
- **Scale step count** based on complexity (add/remove steps as needed)
- **Tailor troubleshooting** to actual common issues for that product

### Step 5: Follow Writing Standards
Every paragraph must follow these rules:
- **Maximum 3 sentences** per paragraph
- **Present tense, active voice** ("Tap" not "Tapped" or "You should tap")
- **One action per numbered step**
- **Exact button/screen names** in **bold**
- **Include timing** when actions take more than a few seconds
- **Explain "why"** for non-obvious steps using 💡 Tips
- **6th grade reading level** - avoid jargon or define it immediately

---

## Structure Requirements

### Progressive Disclosure Pattern
Information must flow in this order:
1. 📦 Physical inventory (What's In Your Box)
2. 🔑 Prerequisites (what must be true BEFORE starting)
3. 🚀 Step-by-step hardware setup
4. 📱 Software/interface orientation (if complex UI)
5. 🔌 Peripheral integration (if applicable)
6. ✅ Hardware validation checkpoint
7. 🌐 Backend verification (if portal-dependent)
8. 🎯 Final success criteria
9. 📞 Support information
10. 🔧 Quick troubleshooting reference
11. 📋 Daily operations checklist
12. 🎓 Additional resources

**Do not skip sections** - if a section doesn't apply, briefly note why:
> 💡 **Note:** This device doesn't require peripheral connections, so Section X is not applicable.

### Validation Checkpoints
After EVERY major step, include:

✅ **Success Check:** [Specific, observable outcome]

Users must know if they succeeded BEFORE moving to the next step.

### Inline Troubleshooting
Immediately after each step's success check, add:

⚠️ **[Context] Troubleshooting:**
- **[Symptom]?** [Quick fix]
- **[Symptom]?** [Quick fix]
- **[Symptom]?** [Escalation path]

Do NOT defer troubleshooting to end of document for setup steps.

---

- [ ] Exact button/screen labels used (in **bold**)
- [ ] Present tense, active voice throughout
- [ ] "Why" explanations for non-obvious steps
- [ ] 6th grade reading level (use Hemingway Editor or similar)
- [ ] One action per numbered step
- [ ] No vague terms ("probably", "might", "usually" without context)

### Completeness
- [ ] User can complete setup without external help
- [ ] All prerequisites listed and verifiable
- [ ] Common failure modes addressed
- [ ] Hardware inventory complete and accurate
- [ ] Support contact information provided
- [ ] What to have ready for support call listed
- [ ] Related documentation linked appropriately

### Technical Accuracy
- [ ] All navigation paths tested on actual device

- [ ] Works offline or with poor connectivity in mind
- [ ] Language appropriate for non-technical users
- [ ] No assumptions about technical knowledge
- [ ] Daily operations checklist is practical

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

If your documentation has ANY of these, fix before publishing:

❌ **User must "figure out" any step** - every action must be explicit

❌ **Assumes knowledge not taught earlier** - be fully self-contained or link clearly

❌ **Paragraph over 3 sentences** - break it up immediately

❌ **Vague troubleshooting** - "try again" or "contact support" without diagnostics

❌ **Missing validation checks** - user can't tell if step succeeded

❌ **Technical jargon unexplained** - define or avoid

❌ **Generic placeholders still present** - all `[brackets]` must be replaced

❌ **Comments still in document** - all `<!-- -->` must be deleted

❌ **"Should see" without specifics** - say EXACTLY what appears

❌ **No time estimates** - users need to plan their setup

❌ **Support info missing** - users must know how to get help

❌ **Prerequisites untestable** - user can't verify they're ready

---

## Testing Your Documentation

Before finalizing:

1. **Dogfood it yourself**
   - Follow the guide step-by-step on actual hardware
   - Time yourself to verify time estimates
   - Note any confusion points

2. **Test with unfamiliar user**
   - Find someone who hasn't seen this device
   - Watch them follow your guide (don't help!)
   - Note where they struggle or ask questions

3. **Technical validation**
   - Verify all internal links work (especially cross-folder)
   - Check images display correctly
   - Confirm markdown renders properly
   - Test on mobile (many users read docs on phones)

4. **Run through quality checklist**
   - Complete entire checklist above
   - Fix any items that don't pass

5. **Final read-through**
   - Read aloud to catch awkward phrasing
   - Check for consistent terminology
   - Verify tone is helpful, not condescending

---

## Common Customization Scenarios

### Scenario: Product has no peripherals
- Keep 🔌 Hardware Integration section header
- Add note: "This device doesn't require peripheral connections. Skip to Hardware Setup Validation."
- Remove Part A, Part B subsections

### Scenario: Product doesn't need Portal configuration
- Keep 🌐 section header
- Add note: "This device is self-contained and doesn't require portal configuration. Skip to Success Criteria."
- Remove verification subsections

### Scenario: Very simple setup (3-4 steps total)
- Still include all main sections for consistency
- Combine steps where logical
- Make Daily Operations simpler/shorter
- Still include troubleshooting for common issues

### Scenario: Complex setup (20+ steps)
- Break into logical phases with sub-headers
- Add progress indicators (e.g., "Step 5 of 12")
- Include intermediate validation checkpoints
- Consider adding a visual flowchart in assets/

### Scenario: Multiple hardware variants
- Create separate docs OR use clear variant callouts
- Example: "⚠️ **Note for Model X users:** Step 3 is slightly different - [explain]"
- In general, prefer separate docs if variants differ significantly

---

## Distinctions from Other Templates

### vs. TEMPLATE_FEATURE_REFERENCE.md
- **Onboarding**: Initial setup, first-time configuration, getting started
- **Reference**: How features work, what buttons do, detailed functionality
- **Rule**: If user needs it on Day 1 to get running → Onboarding. If it's about using features after setup → Reference.

### vs. TEMPLATE_TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- **Onboarding**: Inline troubleshooting for setup steps, quick fixes
- **Troubleshooting**: Detailed diagnostic procedures, complex problems, symptom → solution mapping
- **Rule**: Setup-specific issues → inline in Onboarding. Ongoing operational issues → dedicated Troubleshooting doc.

### vs. Operational Procedures
- **Onboarding**: One-time setup and initial configuration
- **Operational**: Daily workflows, recurring tasks, shift procedures
- **Rule**: First-time only → Onboarding. Every day/shift → Operational doc.
