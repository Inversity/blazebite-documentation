## 🖨️ Connecting Your Bluetooth Printer

### Part A: Pair the Printer (One-Time Setup)

First, you need to pair the printer with the tablet using Android's Bluetooth settings through Esper:

1. **Power on your Star TSP100 printer**
   - Connect printer to power outlet
   - Press the power button on the back
   - Wait for the printer to initialize (lights will stop flashing)

2. **Open Esper Settings on the tablet**
   - Swipe down from the top of the screen with two fingers
   - Tap the gear icon (⚙️) to open Esper Settings
   - Or find "Esper Settings" in the app drawer

3. **Navigate to Bluetooth settings**
   - Tap "Connected Devices" or "Bluetooth"
   - Make sure Bluetooth is turned **ON** (toggle switch should be blue/green)

4. **Put printer in pairing mode**
   - Your TSP100 should appear in the "Available Devices" list automatically
   - If not, hold the printer's feed button for 3 seconds
   - Look for device names like "TSP100", "Star TSP100", or similar

5. **Pair the printer**
   - Tap on your printer's name in the Available Devices list
   - If prompted for a PIN, try: `0000`, `1234`, or `1111`
   - Wait for "Paired" or "Connected" status

✅ **Success Check:** Printer shows as "Paired" or "Connected" in Bluetooth settings

⚠️ **Pairing Troubleshooting:**
- **Printer not appearing?** Make sure it's powered on and within 10 feet of the tablet
- **Pairing failed?** Turn Bluetooth off and on again, then retry
- **Wrong PIN?** Try common PINs: 0000, 1234, 1111, 9999

---

### Part B: Connect Printer in Kitchen App

After pairing in Esper Settings, you need to connect the printer within the Kitchen app:

1. **Open the Kitchen app** (if not already open)

2. **Open the hamburger menu** (☰) and tap **Settings**

3. **Tap "Printer Settings"** or "Hardware"

4. **Tap "Connect Printer"** or "Select Printer"

5. **Choose your printer** from the list
   - You should see your TSP100 printer listed
   - Tap on the printer name to select it

6. **Wait for connection confirmation**
   - The app will test the connection
   - You should see "Printer Connected" or a green checkmark

✅ **Success Check:** Settings screen shows printer status as "Connected" with printer name

⚠️ **App Connection Troubleshooting:**
- **Printer not listed?** Go back and verify the printer is paired in Esper Settings
- **Connection failed?** Ensure printer is powered on and has paper loaded
- **"Printer offline"?** Turn the printer off and on again, then reconnect

---

### Step 5: Test Print Your First Order Ticket

Now let's verify everything is working correctly:

1. **Load thermal paper** in the printer
   - Open the printer cover
   - Insert paper roll with paper feeding from the bottom
   - Pull a few inches of paper through the output slot
   - Close the cover until it clicks

2. **In the Kitchen app, go to Settings**

3. **Find "Test Print" or "Print Test Page"**

4. **Tap to print a test ticket**

5. **Verify the printout**
   - Check that text is clear and readable
   - Ensure all information printed completely
   - Verify paper cuts cleanly (if auto-cut is enabled)

✅ **Success Check:** Test ticket prints clearly with all text visible

⚠️ **Print Troubleshooting:**
- **Nothing prints?** Check that printer is connected in Kitchen app, not just paired in Bluetooth
- **Blank paper feeds?** Paper may be loaded backwards - check that thermal side faces the print head
- **Garbled text?** Reconnect printer in Kitchen app Settings
- **Paper jam?** Open printer cover, remove paper, check for obstructions, reload paper

💡 **Tip:** The thermal side of the paper is usually slightly shinier or you can test by scratching it with your fingernail - it will leave a dark mark.

4. **Confirm locations appear** in the Kitchen app
   - They should match what you set up in the Portal

✅ **Success Check:** Location Presets in Kitchen app match Portal settings
